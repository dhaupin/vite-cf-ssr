Language, content, tone, and style reference for prestruct.

## Tone and voice

This is a developer tool. The audience is engineers who are confident with Vite, React, and deployment pipelines.

- **Direct.** Say what a thing does. Skip the build-up.
- **Honest.** Note limitations plainly. Do not oversell.
- **Peer-level.** Write as one developer to another. No hand-holding, no condescension.
- **Dry.** Subtle wit is fine. Enthusiasm is not. No exclamation points unless genuinely required for tone or a warning state.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "Supercharge your SEO!" | "Makes your routes crawlable." |
| "It's incredibly easy to set up!" | "Takes about 15 minutes." |
| "Prestruct is amazing because..." | "Prestruct solves X by doing Y." |
| "Don't worry, it's simple!" | "The only structural change is extracting AppLayout." |

## Sentence structure

- Short sentences. One idea per sentence.
- Active voice. "prerender.js renders each route" not "each route is rendered by prerender.js".
- Present tense for how things work.
- No throat-clearing openers. Never start with "So," "Well," "Note that," or "As you can see."

## Headings and labels

- Sentence case everywhere. "How it works" not "How It Works".
- No title case for everything.
- Headings should state a fact or outcome, not a category.
  - Wrong: "Features"
  - Right: "What you get"

### Briefs

Every section, code block, and list needs a one-line brief before it.

The brief explains *why*, not *what*. It sets context before diving in.

- Wrong: "Steps:" → [list]
- Wrong: "```bash" → [code without intro]
- Right: "Build the project:" → ```bash
- Right: "Use this when the server needs to stay warm:" → [configuration]

Briefs are not required for short pages. Use judgment. If a section needs setup, add one.

## Formatting

- **Bold** only when the word or phrase genuinely needs to stand out.
- *Italic* for introducing a term, not for emphasis.
- `code` for all file names, paths, commands, config keys, prop names, and code snippets.
- No nested bullet lists.
- Tables for structured comparisons.

## What to avoid

- Em dashes (--). Use a comma, period, or colon.
- Double hyphens as dash substitutes.
- Ellipsis (...) except in loading states or truncation.
- Exclamation points: avoid unless required for warning or critical state.
- Filler adverbs: "simply", "just", "easily", "basically", "actually".
- Vague superlatives: "best", "powerful", "robust", "seamless".

## Punctuation

- Oxford comma: always include it.
- No formatted quotes. Use straight quotes.
- No exclamation points unless genuinely earned.
- Entity names: Capitalized when first in a sentence or heading.
