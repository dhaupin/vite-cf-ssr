/**
 * src/islands.js
 * ==============
 * Engine file -- copy once, never edit.
 *
 * Mounts dynamic React components into <pre-island> placeholders after
 * the main app hydrates. Each island is a hole punched through the
 * prerendered HTML: invisible to crawlers, filled for human visitors.
 *
 * Usage -- call mountIslands() in AppLayout's route-change effect after each
 * navigation. This ensures islands mount on both hard loads and SPA transitions.
 * The WeakSet prevents double-mounting if the same element is scanned twice.
 *
 *   import { mountIslands } from './islands.js'
 *   import { islands } from './AppIslands.jsx'
 *
 *   // Inside ScrollToTop's useEffect([pathname]):
 *   const t = setTimeout(() => mountIslands(islands), 0)
 *   return () => clearTimeout(t)
 *
 * Islands are declared in src/AppIslands.jsx as a name -> component map.
 * Each island in the HTML is a <pre-island> custom element:
 *
 *   <pre-island data-pre-island="recently-viewed"></pre-island>
 *   <pre-island data-pre-island="cart-widget" data-pre-load="visible"></pre-island>
 *   <pre-island data-pre-island="promo-banner" data-pre-load="idle"></pre-island>
 *
 * Load strategies (data-pre-load):
 *   eager   -- mount immediately. Default if omitted.
 *   visible -- mount when the element enters the viewport (IntersectionObserver).
 *   idle    -- mount during browser idle time (requestIdleCallback).
 *
 * Fallback content:
 *   Any children inside <pre-island> are shown before the island mounts.
 *   They are replaced when the React component renders.
 *
 *   <pre-island data-pre-island="cart-widget">
 *     <span class="island-loading">Loading cart...</span>
 *   </pre-island>
 *
 * SSR behavior:
 *   <pre-island> is a custom element. React's renderToString passes it
 *   through as plain HTML -- no guard needed. Fallback content renders
 *   in the static HTML and is visible to crawlers. The React component
 *   never runs at build time.
 *
 * Island components receive no props by default. To pass data, use
 * data attributes and read them from the element ref inside the component,
 * or pull from a global store / localStorage / fetch.
